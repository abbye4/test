        London is the capital of England. It is the largest city of England and
        has a population of over 9 million people. We were a bit unfortunate and
        travel during an intense heatwave. We experienced high temperatures and
        were advised to only use the tubes if neccesary. Despite the heat, we were able to 
        visit the many highlights of London. We were in London for a total of 3 days.

          <dd>
            This Cathedral is an Angelican church that is the seat of the Bishop
            of London. It is dedicated the Apostle Paul. We did not get to tour
            the inside, but the exterior was beautiful to see.
          </dd>
          <dt>Buckingham Palace</dt>
          <dd>
            A trip to London is not complete without a trip to Buckingham
            Palace. The Queen was not at the office, but we did get to see the
            changing of the guards.
          </dd>
          <dt>London Eye</dt>
          <dd>
            The London Eye also refered to as the Millennium Wheel is a large
            observation wheel. It is located on the South Bank of the River of
            Thames. On the wheel you are able to see a bird's eye view of the
            city.
          </dd>
          <dt>Tower Bridge</dt>
          <dd>
            The bridge is a suspension bridge built between 1886 and 1894. It
            crosses the River of Thames. While visiting we had the opportunity
            to see the bridge open and allow boats to cross under the bridge.
          </dd>
          <dt>Westminster Abbey</dt>
          <dd>
            Locatated in the city of Wesminster, it is a Gothic church. It is
            where several of the royals exchanged vows. It is also the
            traditional location for coronations. Notable individuals such as
            Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin were laid to rest inside the
            chapels.
