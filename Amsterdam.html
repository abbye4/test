        Amsterdam is the capital city of the Netherlands and the city with the
        most populations. It boast a large number of canals that make for
        beautiful pictures. We only got to spend a full day in the city. We
        strolled the streets, ate great food, and visited a museum all while
        avoiding the bike riders.

          <dt>Canal Cruise</dt>
          <dd>
            This was the best way to see the beautiful city. We rode the boat cruise at 
            sunset and got to see the city in a different light. We enjoyed refreshments 
            as we marveled at the architecture.

          <dt>Rijksmuseum</dt>
          <dd>
            A beautiful museum that is dedicated to the Dutch arts and history. The building itself
            is a work of art. We got to see paintings by notable artist such as Rembrandt and Vermeer.
          </dd>
          <dt>Royal Palace, Amsterdam</dt>
          <dd>
            The royal palace was built during the Dutch Golden Age. It was to be used as a city hall. 
            It later became the palace of King Louis Napoleon. We did not visit the interior, but the 
            exterior was just as magnificent. 
          </dd>
          <dt>Amsterdam Cheese Museum</dt>
          <dd>
            Amsterdam is known for amazing cheese. We got to sample a variety of cheeses and 
            look at the proccess of making cheese. 
            It is a small, yet cute museum to visit.
