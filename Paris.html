        Paris is the largest and captial city of France. It is very densely populated. 
        The city is beautiful, although not always how they picture it in the movies. 
        We had a short time of the city, but we managed to hit the highlights and of 
        course visit the Mona Lisa.

            What's more iconic than the Eiffel Tower? We spent most of our time admiring the beauty. 
            It is a great stop to have a picnic. You might even see a wedding proposal.
