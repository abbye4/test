        My husband and I have dreamed of traveling to Europe and immersing
        ourselves in the culture. We could never find the best approach to
        planning a trip of that caliber. A friend ours introduced us to
        <a href="https://www.efultimatebreak.com/" title="link to external site"
          >EF Ultimate Break</a
        >, which is a company that plans a variety of trips for individuals
        18-35 years of ages. It allows you to pay for your trip over time and
        you don't have to plan a thing. They take care of flights, tours, and
        accomidations. We could not have found a more perfect way to travel
        oversees for the first time. We decided a year ago to sign up for a
        European Roadtrip!
      </p>
      <p>
        The trip we selected was a 17 day tour of the major cities of Europe. We
        traveled from Houston, Texas to London, United Kingdon. The tour coninued
        to Amsterdam, Paris, Lucerne, Venice, Florence, and ended in Rome. Since
        the tour was a "roadtrip", we took a couple of trains, buses and a
        ferries to travel through Europe. We saw beautiful sceneries and
        architecture. We embarked on an amazing adventure.
